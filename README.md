This tool serves to extract contact information from specific contacts using Gmail API, and appends data appropriately to a document using Google Sheets API

To use, program will prompt user to input the amount of emails they want to parse, and get to work. Program has built in list of senders to parse data from, but this could easily be changed

Note: Must already have a Google Sheets document and ID coded into the program (variable called "SHEETS_ID)
